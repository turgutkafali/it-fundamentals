        There are many ways to become part of the rowing community. As a rower, a coach, an official or a supporter. As a rower the opportunities include flat water, coastal, indoor, para as well as age group rowing including masters, university, under-23 and junior.

For those looking to develop rowing further, World Rowing has compiled a toolkit in order to (further) develop rowing in your country.

        <li><b>Hong Kong China </b>dominated the lightweight categories, winning the lightweight men’s and women’s 2000m event in both senior and under-23 age groups.  For the Hong Kong team, one of the most highly-anticipated races was the lightweight men’s under-23 2000m in which Chan Chi Fung took gold and recorded the fastest time for lightweights overall of 6:22.0. Fung has set a number of World Records on Concept2 sliders over the past few months.</li>
        <li>“Due to the <i>Hong Kong China</i>impact of the  pandemic,<a href="https://worldrowing.com/2021/01/27/asia-qualifier-acts-as-motivator-for-indoor-rowers/">all races have</a>  been suspended. The virtual competition offered the platform for rowers to compete with each other around the world,” said Fung. “Since 2018, I have been very eager to participate in indoor rowing competitions at the international level, however, sometimes it was not possible due to the clash between outdoor training and competitions.  This year, the World Rowing Indoor Championships changed into virtual format because of the pandemic and, most importantly, the Asian Qualifier was hosted by Hong Kong. I am honored to take part in it.”</li>
        <li><strong> were </strong>unsure what to expect with the virtual format, but several said that it helped motivate them to keep training.</li>
